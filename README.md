## Instructions for deploying locally (dev chain)

First, navigate to the root directory of the repo. Launch the chain:

```
# Compile the contracts
yarn compile

# Start a local development chain
yarn start

# Run the whole test suite
yarn test
```

**Please Note:** Voting delay and voting period are set to production values, which will affect the length of test runs. Change to the commented out time periods for running tests.
